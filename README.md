Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @diegoquesada.

I'm a software developer interested in C/C++, Linux and Embedded development, Python, home automation and a bunch of other things. As a tech leader I'm also very interested in developing technical people and helping others learn and have fun doing so.

I'm always learning something new. Right now I'm reading on and experimenting with C++20, Golang, and Azure.
